Given an integer, N, traverse its digits (D1,D2,...,Dn) and determine
how many digits evenly divide N (i.e.: count the number of times N divided
by each digit ddi has a remainder of 00). Print the number of evenly divisible digits.

Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same evenly
divisible digit should be counted (i.e.: for N=111, the answer is 3).
