Given an integer, NN, traverse its digits (dd1,dd2,...,ddn) and determine
how many digits evenly divide NN (i.e.: count the number of times NN divided
by each digit ddi has a remainder of 00). Print the number of evenly divisible digits.

Note: Each digit is considered to be unique, so each occurrence of the same evenly
divisible digit should be counted (i.e.: for N=111N=111, the answer is 33).
